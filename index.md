## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 6, Part 2

  I enjoyed this part of the lab because i thought it was fun coding the game of blackjack. I always liked the idea of being able to code a game, i know its a very basic card game to code but i still thought it was really fun and i enjoyed it a lot. Especially the process of doing bools and if statements.


* Lab 9, Part 2

  Just like the last lab i talked about i also enjoyed this one because of the process of coding a game through if statements. The game is a secret number and having to guess it. Its a really basic game using if statements but for some reason to me its really satisfying coding things like this.


* Lab 11, Part 1 and 2

  This lab is different from the last 2 i talked about it has nothing to do with coding a game it has to do with coding classes. It was different from all the other labs we did and i found myself really enjoying this one. I personally felt like i learned a lot in the process of learning how to do this lab.
